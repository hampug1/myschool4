 The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than  
 they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descriptions to 
 help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses
  the canteen could be provided with a school canteen acount on the school website that keeps track of their 
  previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they might have. Ordering online by ticking a box and
   paying for meals online can elimanate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated
   for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is key.

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Accuracy <br>
   Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure
   accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide
   accurate performance and payroll data.
   <br>
   2.Economics <br>
   Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting
    an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse and over payment.
   As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium group found that large organizations save up to 1,600 per
   employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
   <br>
3.productivity/efficiency<br>
 Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to 
 process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up
  precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to 
  automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy
   helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more

    tracking, Security, and Compliance
